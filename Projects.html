        <h2>Dlewor</h2>
        <p>
            Dlewor(TM) (prounounced "del-wor") is a word guessing game that tasks
            the player with correctly selecting a random five-letter word. You only get
            six tries to guess the word but the game will give you hints with every guess.
            You start out by guessing a word without any hints, and the game will
            reveal if you 1) guessed the correct letter in the correct place (green), 2)
            guessed the correct letter but it is in an incorrect place (yellow), or 3) guess
            a letter that does not appear in the word at all (grey). This is not Wordle &copy; please do not sue me.

        <h2>Sorting and Ranking of Chess Players</h2>
        <p>

            In this lab, I have a found a dataset of over 20,000 Chess Games. I created a class for the data in your
            dataset. Read from the dataset
            to fill an ArrayList with objects of my custom class and developed a sorting algorithm to sort those
            objects in an outputted text file.

        <h2>Infix To PostFix Calculator</h2>
        <p>

            If you are familiar with an infix notation used in arithmetic formulae
            and statements that is characterized by an operator between operands (e.g.,
            1+1). It turns out that infix notation is more difficult to parse by comput-
            ers so it is often preferred to convert it into a prefix (e.g., +11) or postfix
            notation (e.g, 11+) where the operator appears before or after the operands.
            Another major advantage is that prefix and postfix notation makes paren-
            theses obsolete even when order of operations need to be considered (i.e.,
            multiply and divide operations take precedence over add and subtract). Many
            desktop and handheld computers implement a postfix calculator under the
            hood to this day for the reasons stated above.
            In this lab, I implemented an infix to postfix converter, and a
            postfix evaluator. Using the Stack DataType in Java.

        <h2>Spaceship Frogger</h2>
        <p>As my one of my project as a student of Googles Computer Science Summer Institute, I
            created a spaceship version of Frogger using strictly P5JS.
